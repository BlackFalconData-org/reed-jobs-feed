## Key features

🔍 **Smart search with filters**

Search by keyword, location, job type (permanent/contract/temp), work type (full-time/part-time), salary range, graduate roles, and specific employers.

📄 **Detail enrichment**

Fetch full job descriptions, salary period (annual/hourly), contract type, employment type, yearly salary normalization, and external apply URLs.

🔄 **Incremental mode**

Only get new or changed listings since your last run. Content hash per listing — no duplicates, no re-processing.

⚡ **Compact output for AI agents**

Core-fields-only mode optimized for MCP and AI agent workflows. Description truncation to control token budgets.

💰 **Structured salary data**

Min/max salary, yearly normalization, currency, and salary period extracted as discrete fields — not just a text string.

## Use cases

**Job market intelligence**
Track hiring trends across industries, locations, and salary bands. Monitor how many new roles appear daily for specific skills or regions.

**Recruitment pipeline automation**
Feed structured job data into your CRM or ATS. Use incremental mode to only process new listings, reducing API calls and storage.

**Salary benchmarking**
Compare salary ranges across roles, locations, and employers. Yearly normalization lets you compare hourly, daily, and annual rates on equal footing.

**AI and LLM workflows**
Use compact mode and description truncation to feed data into AI agents, MCP servers, and LLM pipelines without exceeding token budgets.

**Academic research**
Study labour market dynamics, skill demand, regional employment patterns, and wage distribution with structured, machine-readable data.

## FAQ

**What is Reed.co.uk?**
Reed is the UK's largest job site, listing over 100,000 active roles from recruitment agencies and direct employers across all industries.

**Is this actor free to run?**
You pay per result: $0.01 per run + $0.002 per job listing. No subscription, no monthly fee. The underlying Reed API is free — you only pay for Apify compute.

**How fast is it?**
Detail enrichment runs at 50 concurrent API calls with zero backoff. 1,000 jobs with full detail enrichment takes approximately 2 seconds of API time.

**How does incremental mode work?**
Each listing gets a content hash. On subsequent runs with the same `stateKey`, only new or changed listings are emitted. Unchanged listings are skipped.

**Can I filter by hourly rate?**
Yes. Set `salaryPerHour: true` and use `salaryFrom`/`salaryTo` as hourly rates (e.g. `salaryFrom: 25` for £25/hour minimum).

**What data is NOT available?**
Remote/hybrid status is not exposed by Reed's API. Contact details (recruiter email/phone) are behind Reed's application wall and cannot be extracted.

---

## Known limitations

- Remote/hybrid status is not available from Reed's API — `isRemote` is always null.
- Contact details (recruiter email, phone) are behind Reed's apply wall and cannot be extracted.
- Reed's API returns 500 for pagination beyond ~100,000 results. For very broad queries, use filters to narrow results.
- Salary data depends on what employers provide — some listings show "Competitive salary" with no numeric values.
- The API key is per-developer, not per-actor. Rate limits (if any) are shared across all uses of the same key.
